# Middleman & Semantic UI Starter Kit

## This is a simple starter kit for building prototypes and demos with Middleman using the Semantic UI framework.

*10/4/18: This is built with older versions of Middleman and Sematic UI and is quite out of date. If you run this you'll see some non-critical errors and may feel nostalgic seeing some old gems.*

### Sematic UI Less-to-Sass Conversion

See `./tasks/converter.rb` for a POC script that will convert all the Less stylesheets to Sass. It's rough, but it works!

## Running Locally

Install Middleman: 

```
$ bundle install
```

Launch project:

```
$ bundle exec middleman server
```

## TO DO 

1. Clean up the base layout!
2. Include some boilerplate style examples and simple UI patterns from Sematic to get things started
